### Welcome to My GitHub Pages Site
Hello! My name is Jeff. I am a systems administrator and, occasionally, systems engineer with experience in Windows and Linux. I have built and managed computing infrastructure for large and small companies alike. I also love to code! I began learning Python in late 2015 and am building my skills with the aim to move into opportunities in data science and/or automation engineering. I am looking to pivot from traditional support-based IT roles to something with more of an engineering and/or creative focus. I think I will be successful in this effort because of the tenacity and intellectual curiosity I bring to everything I take on.

### Why this site?
I'm putting up this site because, well, it's free hosting! Seriously, though, GitHub is the best place for folks like me to showcase their projects in an organized manner. With this page and my existing GitHub repos, I hope to show what I can do and what I can offer.

### Code
Check out my repos [here](https://github.com/vsx-gh/)

### Content
Responsibility for any and all content here is mine. Where this site makes use of others' templates, etc., I make proper attribution. I do the same for my code repos.

### Contact
I am open to discussing opportunities for employment, collaboration, or just to chat. Though I am not the most active person on social media, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffreyvansickle).
